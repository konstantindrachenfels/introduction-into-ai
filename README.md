# introduction-into-ai
Learning the basics of machine & deep learning. The machine learning course was based on the USF course from Jeremy Howard.

I learned how to build a random forest from scratch, how to prepare/clean a dataset for machine learning analysis and how to analyze/optimize a random forest. I've learned about factors such as over-fitting, the analysis of feature importance, confidence analysis, one-hot encoding, partial dependance and extrapolation.
