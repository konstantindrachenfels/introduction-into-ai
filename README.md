# introduction-into-ai
Learning the basics of machine & deep learning. The machine learning course was based on the USF course from Jeremy Howard (https://course18.fast.ai/ml.html) & led by Dr. Jean Savinien (PhD in mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology & associate professor in data science & AI at emlyon business school). The course in deep learning was led by Dr. Farzad Fathizadeh (lecturer in math, computer science & deep learning at Swansea University & previously Caltech). I took the courses over a period of 3 months where I invested roughly 20h/week into them.

I learned how to build a random forest & a neural netowrk from scratch, how to prepare/clean a dataset and how to analyze/optimize a random forest/neural network. I've learned about factors such as over-fitting, the analysis of feature importance, confidence analysis, one-hot encoding, partial dependance and extrapolation. Libraries that I have worked with are fast.ai, scikit-learn, TensorFlow & Keras.
