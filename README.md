Learning the basics of machine & deep learning. The machine learning course was based on the USF course from Jeremy Howard & led by Dr. Jean Savinien (PhD in mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology & associate professor in data science & AI at emlyon business school). The course in deep learning was led by Dr. Farzad Fathizadeh (lecturer in math, computer science & deep learning at Swansea University & previously Caltech)

I learned how to build a random forest from scratch, how to prepare/clean a dataset for machine learning analysis and how to analyze/optimize a random forest. I've learned about factors such as over-fitting, the analysis of feature importance, confidence analysis, one-hot encoding, partial dependance and extrapolation.
